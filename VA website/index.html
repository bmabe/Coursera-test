  <h2>Why am I doing this website?</h2>
  <p>I am hoping to share my experience so that it may help others to complete medical claims more effectively and efficiently As a retiree the TAPS/GPS classes provided by specific services where fine but the VA claims process was not that helpful or existant.</p>

  <h2>Starting the Medical Claim Process</h2>
    <p>Veterans that are thinking about retiring from active duty should start getting medical records up to date. That is see the Primary Care Manager and ensure that all ailments, past injuries and illnesses of any kind are recorded in the official medical record.</p>
    
    <p>Also at a year to six months before actual retirement it would be beneficial to obtain a copy of your medical record, hard copy and/or electronic, go through it and ensure all past injuries and ailments are listed in your personal medical documentation/record. Your name, date and Physician information should be included with any visit documentation that may be used as a part of your medical claim. Each visit to a medical facility is documented therefore, ensure to ask for any care or diagnosis. Medical visits from any referral visits that are not with your branch of military doctors should be included in medical records as well. It is especially crucial for the USCG since the medical computer systems are not connected to other branches. Ensure the all medical visits outside your branch are placed in your record kept with your PCM, request copies and provide them to medical command.</p>

    <p>Three copies of the medical records are recommended: one for keeping, one for the VA and one to keep safely away from present residence i.e. parents or bank lock box.</p>

   <h2>Volunteer Organizations that Provide a Great Service</h2>
   <p>Do not complete a claim without the help of Veteran Service Organization (VSO). I recommend to seek out a VSO and a good place to start is with the links below but there are more. They will help with the process and have contacts with the VA.</p>
  	<h3>Some Veterans Organizations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.amvets.org" target="_blank">AMVETS</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.dav.org" target="_blank">DAV</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.dvs.virginia.gov/" target="_blank">State VA</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.vfw.org" target="_blank">VFW</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.legion.org" target="_blank">American Legion</a></li>
    </ul>
  </section>  
  <section id="Forms">
   <h2>Links and Forms with Explanations</h2>
    <p>Veterans that have an approved retirement date should start the process Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) 180 days before actual retirement. Since DD214 are not generated 180 days prior to retirement documentation showing an approved retirement date may be required of the VSO. To read in detail about BDD the follow the provided link for further elaboration.  <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/predischarge/index.asp" target="_blank">Benefits Delivery at Discharge</a></p>
    <p>What documentation is needed to start a claim? The former question is an important one but not that difficult. Follow the link to the AMVETS website.  <a href="http://www.amvets.org/veteran-services/filing-a-va-claim/" target="_blank">Required documents/information to file a VA claim</a> 
     <ul>
       <li>Service medical records</li>
       <li>Private physician’s records</li>
       <li>Applicable photographs</li>
       <li>DD Form 214</li>
       <li>Marriage certificate</li>
       <li>Birth certificates of children</li>
       <li>Copies of dependents’ Social Security cards</li>
       <li>Divorce Certificates/Decrees</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The list above is mostly taken from the AMVETS website with the exception of Divorce Certificates/Decrees and any VSO would need the above data/records. Service medical records have been stressed but in my case; I was informed that it was a HIPAA violation for the State VA to review the records with me. Also when you get the latest and signed DD214 visit the medical center where the record is maintained and inform them to forward the medical record to the records management center (do not know much about this place). The first three is needed for claim evidence that would have taken place during active duty. DD 214 is the only reliable proof that you were actually in the military. The final three are for dependent proof/verification. The data will be used to complete the below forms. Note due to obvious reasons not all forms may not be needed.</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-526EZ-ARE.pdf" target="_blank">Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits form 21-526EZ</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-686C-ARE.pdf" target="_blank">Declaration of Status of Dependents VA form 21-686C</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-22-ARE.pdf" target="_blank">VSO Claimant Power of Attorney VA form 21-22</a></li>
     </ul>
    <p>The links above go to the VA website and can be filled out online but should be saved. They can be saved, printed and filled out in hand also. Needless to say I recommend completing them at home before going to a VSO to save time and confusion when getting all the data together. The VSO may require documentation along with any completed forms due to verification.</p>
    <p>After a claim has been submitted a notification will be sent from a contracting company called QTC, which is a Lockheed Martin subsidiary, group of doctors that exam and verify claim. Local travel checks will be filled out in the patients name at each appointment that is required.
